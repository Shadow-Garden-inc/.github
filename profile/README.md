# 👋 Shadow Garden Inc.

An engineering collective building **automation-first systems**, **AI-assisted tools**, and **clean backend services**.

We focus on things that ship, scale, and survive contact with reality.

- **Verification over vibes**
- **Readable code over clever code**
- **AI as augmentation, not authority**

If a system can’t explain itself, it doesn’t belong in production.

## 🧪 Repositories

This organization hosts:
- Production-ready tools
- Experimental systems
- Reference implementations
- Learning projects with real constraints

Not every repo is stable.  
Each repo documents its **status**, **scope**, and **intent**.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions that improve:
- Correctness
- Maintainability
- Performance
- Documentation

Rules are simple:
1. One problem per PR.
2. No magic — explain assumptions.
3. Small changes beat heroic rewrites.
4. Broken logic > broken style (fix logic first).

Low-signal PRs will be closed.
